### Image Quality Assessment of Digital Image Capturing Devices for Melanoma Detection

- By using handheld and/or digital dermoscopy, evaluating and detecting skin cancers such as melanoma can become much easier
- The purpose of this study was to evaluate any color errors in the images due to different lighting conditions or camera settings

- Above, the test setup used in this experiment.
  - Two adjustable LED lights are used for illumination of the chart.
  - The intensity and focus of the lights was controlled on a digital light meter.
- Found that all cameras have some level of error when on the "automatic" setting, but this can be eliminated by adjusting the camera manually or through image post-production
- These steps can greatly increase image quality, and make it much easier to analyze
